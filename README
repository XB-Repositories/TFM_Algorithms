This directory contains the Tabu Search and Variable Function Search algorithms used in the Master's Thesis of Xabier Benavides. In order to execute the algorithms, please follow the following steps:

- Enter the corresponding directory (TabuSearch or VariableFunctionSearch).

- Compile the code using the "make" command.

- Execute the algorithms using the following commands:

    - Tabu Search: ./TS [Instance] [Random seed] [Tabu list size] [Number of solution evaluations]

    - Variable Function Search: ./VFS [Instance] [Random seed] [Tabu list size] [Number of solution evaluations]
